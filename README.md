# StupidMachine

Your stupid machine doesn't even know how to read. So we have to teach it how to do it.

More spesifically, we're going to learn it how to use Python to recognize handwritten digits, with a little help from the MNIST dataset, Scikit Learn and the K Nearest Neighbor algorithm.

For this tutorial, you'll need the following installed on your computer:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scikit Learn 
- Scipy
- Matplotlib

If you already have pip installed, simply type the following into your command line interface:

`sudo pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn scipy matplotlib`
